## 1. Dataset description ([to top](#top))
As first step we load the whole London Dataset and search for interesting numerical information.

The original dataset consists of 13.490.604 records, each record is described by 7 variables:

- The ``lsoa_code`` is a code that identifies the 4835 different LSOAs (Lower Layer Super Output Area), namely a geographic area inside London.

- The ``borough`` is a nominal variable that identifies one of the 33 borouhgs present in London, each of them contains a variable number of LSOAs.

- The ``major_category`` is a categorical attribute that specifies the category of the crime committed; there are 9 major categories: ``Theft and Handling``, ``Violence Against the Person``, ``Criminal Damage``, ``Robbery``, ``Burglary``, ``Other Notifiable Offences``, ``Drugs``, ``Sexual Offences``, ``Fraud or Forgery``.

- The ``minor_category`` is a categorical attribute that specifies precisely the crime commited; there are 32 minor categories.

- The ``year`` is a numerical attribute that indicates the year when the crime was committed, the crimes are collected for the year in the range [2008,2016].

- The ``month`` is a numerical attribute that defines in which month the crime was commited.

- The ``value`` is a numerical attribute that indicates how many crimes of a certain type in a certain period in a LSOA were commited.

## 2. Data Cleaning ([to top](#top))
In this stage, we investigate the presence of missing or useless values.

### 2.A Missing Values ([to top](#top))
Reviewing the data, there aren't null values or missing ones.

### 2.B Record Filtering ([to top](#top))
We choose to keep all columns in order to be able to analyze from different perspectives the crime distribution; but comes out that approximately the 70% of the records has a value equal to zero.

Considering a generic line of the dataset: 

for each ``lsoa_code``, ``minor_category``, ``month`` and ``year`` the ``value`` attribute specifies how many crimes of that kind were commited, even if there isnâ€™t any crime that was commited.

Since a ``value`` = 0 gives no contribution for the computation of the standard statistical measures, the dataset was filtered deleting all the rows where the ``value`` was equal to 0.
This operation leads to an important memory space saving: we started with about 13M records and, after the filtering, we ended up with 3M *non-zero* records (the 23% of the real size).
This will also allowed a faster of computatios.

## 3. Exploratory Analysis ([to top](#top))
Now that our data is cleaned, we can explore them using standard visual and statistical tools.

### 3.A Features Distributions ([to top](#top))
We start our analysis by having a look at the ditribution of the number of crimes over the years.

![All Crimes](imgs/crime_year.png)

The line graph above shows that the number of crimes is equally distributed between the years with the peaks in 2008, 2012 and 2016; while in 2013 and 2014 there were fewer crimes.
In particular, the maximum number of crimes is in 2008 with a total of 738k crimes, while the lowest value is in 2014 with 680k crimes.

The trend can be defined as costant unless small fluctuations of $\pm 0.1\%$.
